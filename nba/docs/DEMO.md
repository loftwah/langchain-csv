# Fantasy Basketball Tools Demo Guide

This document provides a step-by-step guide for demonstrating the Fantasy Basketball Tools application.

## Preparing for the Demo

1. Make sure you have a stable internet connection
2. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   uv pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Test the application before your presentation:
   ```bash
   python fantasy-tools.py
   ```

## Demo Flow

### 1. Introduction (1-2 minutes)
- Introduce the Fantasy Basketball Tools as a suite of analytics tools for fantasy basketball managers
- Highlight the key features: Draft Helper, Matchup Analyzer, Consistency Tracker, and Game Simulator
- Mention that it uses real NBA data via the official NBA API

### 2. Draft Helper Demo (3-4 minutes)
- Show how the Draft Helper identifies undervalued players
- Demonstrate changing the scoring system and minimum games played
- Highlight how the tool visualizes value vs. average draft position
- Point out specific player recommendations that might be surprising

### 3. Matchup Analyzer Demo (3-4 minutes)
- Load preset teams (e.g., "Offense vs Defense" or "Stars vs All-around")
- Explain how the tool breaks down category strengths and weaknesses
- Show the head-to-head category predictions
- Demonstrate how users can customize teams with specific players

### 4. Consistency Tracker Demo (2-3 minutes)

- Highlight the data processing techniques that provide accurate fantasy projections

## Tips for a Successful Demo

1. **Prepare Fallbacks**: If the NBA API is slow or unavailable, mention that the tool uses cached data when possible
2. **Know Your Audience**: Adjust technical details based on whether the audience is technical or business-focused
3. **Interesting Insights**: Prepare a few "wow" insights about player performances to highlight during the demo
4. **Interactive Elements**: Encourage the audience to suggest players or matchups to analyze
5. **Clear Visualization**: Make sure your display resolution is set appropriately so data visualizations are clear
