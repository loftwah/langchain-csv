# Code Refactoring Documentation

This document outlines the refactoring applied to the Fantasy Basketball Tools codebase to improve maintainability, extensibility, and code quality.

## Major Refactoring Efforts

### 1. Game Simulator Refactoring

The large `game_simulator` function (600+ lines) in `src/tools.py` was refactored into a modular, object-oriented structure in `src/game.py` with the following components:

- `Player` class: Represents basketball players with stats and in-game performance
- `Team` class: Groups players and manages team-level statistics
- `GameState` class: Tracks the state of an ongoing game 
- `PlayGenerator` class: Handles the generation of basketball plays
- `GameRenderer` class: Formats game results as text and HTML
- `GameSimulator` class: Coordinates the simulation process

Benefits:
- Improved maintainability with focused, single-responsibility classes
- Better extensibility for new features
- Enhanced readability with domain-driven design
- Proper separation of concerns

### 2. Consistency Tracker Refactoring

The `consistency_tracker` function was refactored into a class-based design in `src/tracker.py`:

- `ConsistencyTracker` class: Analyzes player consistency with proper encapsulation
- Clear separation between analysis, visualization, and reporting

Benefits:
- Better organization of related functionality
- Easier to extend with new analysis metrics
- Improved testability with smaller, focused methods

### 3. API Caching Enhancement

Implemented a robust decorator-based caching system in `src/api_cache.py`:

- `APICache` class: Handles the low-level cache operations
- `cache_api_response` decorator: Provides a clean interface for caching
- Support for varying cache timeouts per data type
- Built-in error handling and fallback mechanisms

Benefits:
- Consistent caching behavior across all API calls
- Improved offline reliability
- Reduced code duplication
- Enhanced performance

### 4. Configuration Management

Centralized configuration in `src/config.py` by moving hard-coded values:

- Game simulator parameters
- API cache timeouts
- Consistency thresholds
- Notable player lists
- UI configuration

Benefits:
- Single source of truth for configuration
- Easier to modify behaviors
- Improved code readability without magic numbers

## API Changes

The refactored code maintains backward compatibility through wrapper functions:

- `game_simulator` in `src/tools.py` now calls the refactored implementation
- `consistency_tracker` in `src/tools.py` now calls the refactored implementation
- API functions maintain the same signatures but use the enhanced caching system

## Testing Implications

The refactored code should be easier to test due to:

- Smaller, focused components with clear responsibilities
- Reduced dependencies through better encapsulation
- More predictable behavior with explicit configuration

## Performance Considerations

The refactoring was done with performance in mind:

- Enhanced caching reduces redundant API calls
- Object instantiation overhead is minimal compared to the computational work
- Memory usage may be slightly higher due to object structures, but the organization benefits outweigh this cost

## Future Work

Areas for additional refactoring:

1. Move remaining tool functions into their own modules
2. Implement comprehensive unit testing
3. Consider a dependency injection approach for better testability
4. Further improve error handling and logging
5. Add type hints throughout the codebase

## Conclusion

This refactoring significantly improves the maintainability and extensibility of the codebase, setting the foundation for future development while preserving the existing functionality and API compatibility.
